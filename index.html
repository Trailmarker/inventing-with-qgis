					## Inventing
					
					## with
					
					## QGIS

					#### FOSS4G Oceania Perth Hub 2021
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					this talk is about my experiences developing QGIS plugins from 2019–2021

					working with Gaia Resources
				</section>

					### about me

					* first programmed something in 1987
					* actual programmer since 2004(ish)
					* not actually a proper Python programmer
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### my first programs (bringing these up for a reason)

					* Amstrad PCW-8512 turtle graphics

					### inspirations 
					
					Bret Victor's talk "Inventing on Principle" (CUSEC 2012)

					> "So, unlike the previous session, I don’t have any prizes to give out. I’m just going to tell you how to live your life."
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### inventing on principle
					
					[add references]
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					the big and beautiful messsage in Bret's talk is that technical practice like programming can and should engage our intuition 
					and creativity by *tightening feedback loops*

					go and watch it …
					
					[insert change ←→ see diagram]
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### anatomy of a QGIS plugin
					
					* a Python program that runs inside QGIS and can't really run without QGIS
					* accesses QGIS [link] and Qt [link] APIs to access and process data, make maps, add and remove layers, add and remove tools and toolbars, change symbology and do, well, almost anything
					* Python bootstrapped by QGIS when the plugin is activated
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### NAFI ~~Risk Reduction Program~~ ~~Bushfires NT~~ ~~Burnt Areas Mapping~~ plug-in

					* recent work with North Australia and Rangelands Fire Information [include link] for high resolution fire scar mapping
					* base fire scar information is derived from the Sentinel-5 satellite [include link]

					> "The Sentinel-5 mission consists of high resolution spectrometer system operating in the ultraviolet to
					shortwave infrared range with 7 different spectral bands: UV-1 (270-300nm), UV-2 (300-370nm), VIS (370-500nm), 
					NIR-1 (685-710nm), NIR-2 (745-773nm), SWIR-1 (1590-1675nm) and SWIR-3 (2305-2385nm)."

					* infrared bands → heat information!

					### a bit like app development?

					as with developing an app or an embedded system, the basic model is that you're building your code *outside of the thing it runs on*, 
					then *transferring it to the thing to run*

					*this is slow and it's better if it's faster*
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### making feedback faster (version 1)

					* experiment in the QGIS Python REPL
					* develop code that can be run outside of QGIS
					* write tests for this code
					* Plugin Reloader (also a plugin)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### making feedback faster (version 2)

					* integrate all testing with a full running version of QGIS
					* auto-reload the plugin when code changes
					* use QGIS Processing tools in your code
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					demo - auto-running unit tests in a QGIS plugin
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### QGIS processing framework

					* provides a click-and-connect process modeller
					* access a ~~large~~ *vast* suite of standard QGIS processing tools
					* user interface to activate individual tools, with help
					* package tools with your plugin and use them on an ad hoc basis
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### QGIS processing framework

					* QGIS processing tools can also access any FOSS4G library packaged in Python with QGIS (this is a lot of them)
					* this includes eg GDAL, OGR, OWSLib
					* this is *very powerful*
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					demo - exploratory testing with QGIS processing tools
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Bonus: Qt versus reactive front-end frameworks

					* Qt was invented to do event-driven cross-platform UX programming in C++
					* many extremely cool innovations (signals, slots, layouts)
					* still a leading framework for cross-platform UX (competitors are things like Java, Electron, Tcl/Tk)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### a reactive web front-end … embedded in QGIS

					* it is actually possible to embed web frameworks in QGIS via the QWebView
					* the QWebView can host a full React, Angular, Aurelia, etc application written in JavaScript or TypeScript
				</section>

					demo - reactive TypeScript embedded in QGIS
